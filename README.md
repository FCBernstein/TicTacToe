# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. This software will allow two players to play against each other or for one player to play against the computer. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 3x3 grid of empty spots. The players take turns marking an empty spot with their letter: the first player to move is X and the second player is O. The first player to fill a winning set, defined as a row, column, or diagonal line of three spots, wins. If all spots are filled and neither player has a winning set, then the game results in a tie.

**The full spec for the game is in the repo...**
